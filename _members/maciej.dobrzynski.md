Maciej has been working at the [Cellular Dynamics Lab](https://www.pertzlab.net) at the Institute of Cell Biology at the University of Bern since June 2016, where he has built an HPC cluster and implemented a software stack to analyse images from time-lapse microscopy experiments. He builds custom R pipelines to identify features in single-cell time series and builds R/Shiny apps to visualise the data.


**Developed software**

- [FreeCLust](https://github.com/dmattek/shiny-freeclust): easy interactive clustering and cluster validation
- [Time-course Inspector](https://github.com/dmattek/shiny-timecourse-inspector): visualization, analysis and clustering of time-series data
- [dzPlateViewer](https://github.com/dmattek/dzPlateViewer): an html-based plate viewer for microscopy images using DeepZoom technology
- [ARCOS](https://arcos.gitbook.io/home/): detect and quantify spatio-temporal correlations in time-lapse imaging data


**Current interests**

- analysis of spatio-temporal correlations in time-lapse imaging data
- generation of synthetic microscopy images
- hypothesis learning in automated experiments
- smart microscopy
