I have just finished my PhD in the Pelkmans lab at the University of Zurich and will start working at the FMI Basel in May 2022 in the lab of Prisca Liberali as an image analysis specialist. 
I’m developing python-based image analysis workflows and napari plugin for image visualization focused on high content and 3D imaging workflows (e.g. [this one](https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier)).
