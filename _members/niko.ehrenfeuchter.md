IMCF: Imaging Core Facility lead by [Oliver Biehlmaier](/members/oliver.biehlmaier/)

Niko has been working at the [IMCF](https://biozentrum.unibas.ch/imcf) since 2012 after
leaving the microscopy facility [LIC](https://miap.eu/miap-unit/life-imaging-center/) at
the University of Freiburg, Germany. He is responsible, along with [Kai
Schleicher](/members/kai.schleicher/), [Laurent Guerard](/members/laurent.guerard/) and
Rohan Girish for the advice and follow up of any
research projects involving light microscopy and image processing within the
[Biozentrum](https://biozentrum.unibas.ch/) and occasionally other departments of the
University of Basel.

On top of that, he is responsible for the group's IT infrastructure including the
microscope acquisition computers, analysis workstations, HRM and OMERO servers and the
Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure *VAMP*. Additionally, he's a big Linux enthusiast
with more than two decades of experience on that and a strong advocate of versioning
systems (he's even having his phone's address book in a git repo).

**Background:** Computer Science

**Current interests:**

- Surviving the strong decay in available (human) resources managing our not-so-small IT
  infrastructure.
- Pushing our Desktop Virtualization to the next generation.
- Providing a facility-suitable multi-user accessible heavy-GPU compute environment
  (read: not a *cluster* but something that an average non-computer-scientist can be
  instructed to use easily).

**Areas of expertise:**

- *BioSample Preparation*: If it can be scripted I might be of help here as well -
  otherwise you probably don't want to let me near your lab bench...
- *BioImage Acquisition*: As soon as it's Pixels, I'm all yours. As long as it's still
  Photons, Filters, Mirrors and Lenses, you don't want me to touch it...
- *BioImage Analysis*: Stitching, Deconvolution, Time-lapse, WSI, 3D Analysis

**Heavy user of:** git, fish, bash, VS Code, Sublime Merge, Python, Ansible, PowerShell, Grafana
