IMCF: Imaging Core Facility lead by [Oliver Biehlmaier](/members/oliver.biehlmaier/)

Laurent has been working at the [IMCF](https://biozentrum.unibas.ch/imcf) since 2017 after
leaving the Centre for Cellular Imaging
[CCI](https://www.gu.se/en/core-facilities/centre-for-cellular-imaging) at
the University of GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. He is responsible, along with [Kai
Schleicher](/members/kai.schleicher/), [Nikolaus Ehrenfeuchter](/members/niko.ehrenfeuchter/) and
Rohan Girish for the advice and follow up of any
research projects involving light microscopy and image processing within the
[Biozentrum](https://biozentrum.unibas.ch/) and occasionally other departments of the
University of Basel.

He is also now trying to be more involved in the maintenance of the group's IT
infrastructure including the microscope acquisition computers,
analysis workstations, HRM and OMERO servers and the
Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure *VAMP*.
