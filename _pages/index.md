The Swiss BioImage Analysts’ Society is a network for and by bioimage analysts working in Switzerland. 
It was founded in early 2021 by an initial group of 25 participants. This is a community effort driven by all members, with flexible degrees of involvement: If there is something you would like to see done, the fastest way may well be to just do it.

Since 21.06.2023 SwissBIAS is also a non-profit Association with 8 board members. 

# Want to join us?
SwissBIAS welcomes people working in Switzerland that self-identify as bioimage analysts: This includes facility and technical staff, group leaders, postdocs, and students from universities as well as industry. 

If you have any question, please let us know at **info@swissbias.ch**. If you are ready to join us, fill out [this google form](https://forms.gle/euXVmTocfeDzgEPv9) and we will invite you to join our SLACK workspace and monthly knowledge sharing Zoom meetings.

# What does membership bring?

In order to cover the association expenses and develop new activities, we are introducing in 2024 a nominal membership fee of 50 CHF (25 CHF for PhD Students). However, eager to maintain the welcoming and inclusive nature that defines our community, most activities will remain open to everyone.
By becoming a SwissBIAS member, you will contribute to covering the basic costs of the association, enjoy discounted access to workshops and an annual meeting with registration priority, and gain the privilege to vote during the Annual General Assembly (see table below).
