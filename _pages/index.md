The Swiss BioImage Analystsâ€™ Society is a network for and by bioimage analysts working in Switzerland. 
It was founded in early 2021 by an initial group of 25 participants. This is a community effort driven by all members, with flexible degrees of involvement: If there is something you would like to see done, the fastest way may well be to just do it.

Since 21.06.2023 SwissBIAS is also a non-profit Association with 8 board members. 

# Want to join us?
SwissBIAS welcomes people working in Switzerland that self-identify as bioimage analysts: This includes facility and technical staff, group leaders, postdocs, and students from universities as well as industry. 

If you are interested, email us at **info@swissbias.ch** , and we will invite you to join our SLACK workspace and monthly knowledge sharing Zoom meetings.

Eager to keep the welcoming and inclusive nature that defines our community, most activities are open to everyone. By becoming a SwissBIAS member you help the association to cover the basic costs of the association. As a member, you get discounted access to Workshops and you can vote during the Annual General Assembly(see table below).
