SwissBIAS organizes monthly meetings, an Annual Meeting, and a couple of seminars and workshops per year. While the different activities are described in detail on this page, the actual schedule of our activities is published in the calendar on the [events page](https://swissbias.github.io/events/). 

## Monthly meetings

The monthly meetings are an open forum where everyone can ask questions, share opinions, and give information to the community. Meeting times alternate between the first Tuesday or the first Thursday of each month from 10:00 to 11:00, remotely. The purpose of this alternation is to allow as many people as possible to join meetings.

Follow the #monthly-meeting channel on slack for updates and details.

## Annual meeting

The annual meeting is open to everyone. It is the time of the year to make veterans meet new members, discuss to foster feedback on existing activities and promote new initiatives. The meeting includes various interactive formats such as presentation, an Open Source Software Lounge (OsSL), hackathons, round-tables etc. to discover, present and discuss bioimage analysis tools. The meeting ends with an hour-long General Assembly reserved to SwissBIAS members only.

Every year in Bern, one or two day(s) in the 3rd week of June.

## Workshops

Workshops are organised by SwissBIAS members to promote knowledge exchange and facilitate collaborations. Peer teaching and peer coding are at the core of our workshops. You learn AND you teach! 

Twice a year, in person, in various locations.

## Seminars

SwissBIAS invites external Researcher/Developer to present a new method and demo their tool in a practical oriented seminar (15min talk - 30 min demo - 15 min questions)

Four times a year, remotely.
